Description: recoup calculates and plots signal profiles
    created from short sequence reads derived from Next
    Generation Sequencing technologies. The profiles
    provided are either sumarized curve profiles or heatmap
    profiles. Currently, recoup supports genomic profile
    plots for reads derived from ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq
    experiments. The package uses ggplot2 and ComplexHeatmap
    graphics facilities for curve and heatmap coverage
    profiles respectively.
